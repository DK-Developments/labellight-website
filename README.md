# Printer App

Eliminate manual label printing. Save hours every week with seamless DYMO printer integration for Lightspeed POS.

## The Problem
Manual label printing is time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating. Copying data from Lightspeed to create labels wastes hours every week.

## The Solution
Our browser extension integrates directly with Lightspeed Retail, allowing you to print DYMO labels with a single click—no manual data entry required.

## The Result
Save 10+ hours per week, eliminate data entry errors, and streamline your workflow. Focus on growing your business, not printing labels.

## 🚀 Local Development

Simply open `src/website/index.html` in your browser, or use a local development server:

```
cd src/website
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Create a local config.js file ([Guide](https://www.notion.so/improvement-initiatives/Config-js-How-to-use-2e298a694a5a804496ddd0efaac5d560))
